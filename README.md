The effects of fireworks on airquality in Amsterdam  
  
This project aims to create interpolated maps of particulate matter (PM) pollution in the city centre of Amsterdam. The particulate PM10 will be assessed, which refers to all PM pollutants smaller than 10μm. Human activities such as traffic, agriculture and combustion processes have caused an increase in PM pollution in the atmosphere. Exposure to this PM pollution can have negative effects on your health. Long-term exposure reduces average life expectancy by 13 month and increases sickness absence days by 4.5million in the Netherlands alone.
One of the most notable causes for local increases in PM pollution are fireworks. This project visualizes the effects of fireworks by interpolating maps of PM10 content in the air from 20:00 to 08:00 on new year's eve. The interpolated map are based on the Luchtmeetnet air quality measurements stations in Amsterdam. These stations measure the amount of PM pollution in μg/m3 every hour.
